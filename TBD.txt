Things to do:
* Replace lyrics "source" (scraped from azlrics) to another source or use a 3rd party api (e.g., Genius lyrics). Currently AZLyrics
is blocking my ability to scrape lyrics (i.e., I get 403 forbidden http response)
* Refactor viewVideo.js and searchFav.js as there is a lot of shared if not duplicated logic between the two
* Refine error messaging when lyrics not found (today there is only one message regardless of http response e.g., 404, 403, etc)
* Eval all forms and ensure there is appropriate form validation and error handling 
* There is a LOT of code in the utilities.py file...there is an opportunity reorganize some of this code into separate files so
  so that it would be easier to find the code that I need to find and therefore easier to maintain. 


Futures:
* Add unit test cases
* Document defect fixes...issues I ran into and how I fixed them. 
* Readme for Github 
* Do more testing on video titles to ensure that it works on "corner cases". 
* Redo home page to make it more appealing...e.g., more professionalto give it some pizazz.
* Add an about page to website  
* Add playlist capability and link that with YT playlist feature ()
* Add the ability for user to recover their passwords via email
* Add the ability to have lyrics track the song (e.g., highlight lyrics line to match song...Columbia U project)
